Fort, Daudnagar, Aurangabad : Facts given by Archaeological Society Of
India This fort is situated on the eastern bank of the Sone River and
was founded by Dhaud Khan, a Governor of Bihar under Aurangzeb in the
17th of Palamu fort from the Cheros; and it is said that while back from
this conquest he camped here and founded the town known after him। The
surrounding area was also granted to him as a Jagir by the emperor।
Early in the 18th century Buchanan saw it as a flourishing town with
cloth and opium factories। The sarai built by Daud Khan was, perhaps
really meant to be a stronghold; for it was well fortified with a
battlemented wall, two large gates and a moat all around। It was called
as a sarai probably to avoid jealousy of the Government। The sarai was
in good condition till a few years before 1896; for the Bengal list says
that the gates were regularly shut every night। Ahmad Khan, grandson of
Dhaud Khan, fortified the town which was then named as Ghausipur। The
town also contains an old mosque and another sarai built byAhmad Khan,
which had mud gates। In the outlying part of the town called Ahmadganj
is the tomb of Ahmad Khan।
